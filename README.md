# EmoteGAN
Generate 28x28 Twitch emotes using a GAN (Wasserstein Generative Adverserial Network)

## Why?
This project was started as challenge to myself to implement the knowledge learnt from CS231N (a graduate level course about deep learning and convolutional networks from Stanford University)

## Updates
Training data is taking more time than expected and I will update this repo after optimizing the training code a bit.
